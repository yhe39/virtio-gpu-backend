# libvcamhal.so

libvcamhal.so is a converter which transforms the C++ based libcamhal.so to C-based interfaces.

In addition, acrn-dm cannot access some element of C++ language(eg. the Class and Reference), so we also convert these in this module.

## Build instructions:
- Dependencies: ipu6-camera-hal

- Build and install:
1. build and install the libvcamhal.so
make
make install
